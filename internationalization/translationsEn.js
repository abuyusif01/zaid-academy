On top of achieving academic excellence, he mastered the principles of Quranic tajweed and was certified in three different Quranic recitation styles, namely, Warsh, Qaaloun of Imam Nafi’ and Hafs of Assim. Muhammed is no stranger to Quranic competitions. Having competed in a handful of such events, he managed to secure numerous first place awards, such as in the National Quranic Competition in Dakar, the International Quranic Competition in Malaysia and the Great Africa International Quranic Competition in Tanzania, among many others. Upon graduating from Daroul Imane Institute, the Senegalese bred student of knowledge went on to voluntarily coach junior Quranic reciters and prepare them for competitions. He also served as the Imam for prayers in the said Institute’s prestigious mosque (Daroul Imane Mosque) up until 2020, when he decided to travel to Malaysia and enroll in a Political Science bachelor’s degree in the International Islamic University of Malaysia (IIUM). Together with a number of his companions in the Quranic field, he has co-founded Zaid Academy in hopes to continue the prophetic legacy of teaching the Holy Quran.",
